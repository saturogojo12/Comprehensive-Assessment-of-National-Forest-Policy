# Forest Benefits and Conservation Strategies

## Overview

This project explores the critical roles forests play in our environment and their associated benefits, including:

- **Carbon Sequestration**: Forests absorb 7.6 billion metric tonnes of CO2 annually, significantly reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Biodiversity**: Forests house 80% of Earth's biodiversity, including 2/3 of all plant species and 58% of mammals.
- **Water Regulation**: One-third of the world's metropolises rely on forest-protected areas for their drinking water.
- **Food and Fuel**: Over 1.6 billion people depend on forests for food, fuel, and shelter.

## National and Global Strategies

### National Afforestation Plan
- Launched in 2000 to address deforestation and promote afforestation on degraded lands.
- Includes tree plantations along railway lines, roadsides, and rivers.

### National Mission for Green India
- Launched in 2014 to enhance forest cover and biodiversity at various administrative levels.
- Focus on sustainable practices, community engagement, and reducing illegal forest activities.

### Supporting Policies
- Restrictions on projects in ecologically sensitive areas.
- Encouragement of wood substitution with alternative materials like LPG and solar.

## Community Engagement and Forest Management
- Multistakeholder engagement including local communities, NGOs, and government agencies.
- Policies and programs to improve forest productivity and reduce illegal degradation.

## Key Research Insights
- Studies on community forest dependency reveal factors such as distance from forest and market influence forest product income.
